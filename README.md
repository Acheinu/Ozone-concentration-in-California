# Ozone-concentration Analysis (California)

This project explores air quality data by analyzing the **daily maximum 8-hour ozone concentration** across time and regions. The analysis includes data cleaning, outlier detection, temporal trends, and geospatial visualization to uncover meaningful patterns in ozone pollution.  


## üìå Project Overview  
- **Data Source**: EPA Air Quality System (AQS) dataset  
- **Objective**:  
  - Understand how ozone levels vary across weekdays vs. weekends  
  - Explore monthly and weekly patterns in ozone concentration  
  - Identify and handle outliers  
  - Visualize spatial distribution of ozone in California  


## üõ†Ô∏è Methods & Steps  
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handled missing values and ensured date formatting  
   - Created new features (e.g., weekday vs weekend)  
   - Detected and flagged outliers using IQR method  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Time series visualization of ozone concentration trends  
   - Boxplots comparing weekday vs weekend distributions  
   - Aggregated monthly/weekly averages for trend insights  

3. **Geospatial Analysis**  
   - Plotted site-level ozone concentration across California  
   - Heatmap showing spatial variations in air quality  
   - Highlighted regions with highest ozone levels  


## üìä Key Insights  
- Weekday vs weekend ozone levels show noticeable differences.  
- Outliers (extremely high or low concentrations) were flagged and analyzed.  
- Monthly trends reveal seasonal variations in ozone levels.  
- Geospatial mapping highlights ozone hotspots across California.
